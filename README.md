# Raven for WotLK (_r541_)

* Customizable timer bar and icon configurations to monitor buffs, debuffs and cooldowns.
* Timelines to show buff, debuff and cooldown icons sliding along a bar.
* Comprehensive condition checking to support buffing/debuffing, spell rotations, etc.
* Data broker display with horizontal stripe configuration.
* Value bars to show game and player info plus unit frame data.

_**Under Development**_:

* Multi-target HoT and DoT tracking bars: bars aren't shown properly and disappear a second after they show. So this will be looked into as soon as possible.

## >>> IMPORTANT <<<

This addon is meant to be used for regular _WotLK_ servers and it won't work properly on classless servers (_Project Ascension_) and won't be made compatible for them as it requires **a lot** of work and time that I don't have.
